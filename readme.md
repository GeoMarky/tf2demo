This is tensorflow demo on implementing FWM/JMI and FWI. The codes are in tf2wrw.ipynb tf2fwi.ipynb respectively.

The idea is to compute gradient using [automatic differentiation]{https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiTiMebhOHiAhVCaVAKHXGJDWsQFjACegQIERAG&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAutomatic_differentiation&usg=AOvVaw1xcP0hXCT0vsx2Ffo50Fnh} feature by only defining forward modelling operator and objective function.
